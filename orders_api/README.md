# OrdersApi

This Elixir/Phoenix API is designed to manage orders and payments for e-commerce platforms, enabling the creation of orders, application of payments, and retrieval of detailed order information, including payment statuses.

## Features
- **Create Orders**: Allow orders to be created without an immediate payment.
- **Apply Payments**: Support the application of payments to existing orders, including partial payments.
- **Retrieve Orders**: Fetch detailed information about orders, including all associated payments.
- **Integrated Order Creation and Payment**: Simultaneously create an order and apply an initial payment.

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/orders-api.git
